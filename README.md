# 🔤 Hangman Wordchain (C++ Terminal Game)

A simple terminal-based Hangman game with a twist — each new word continues a **wordchain**, where the next word starts with the last letter of the previous word.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time.
- For every wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
- Once a word is guessed or failed, the next word in the chain starts with the **last letter** of the previous word.
- The game continues until the player loses all lives or completes the word chain.

## ✨ Features

- Terminal-based interface using standard I/O
- Word chaining logic
- Dynamic difficulty (based on word length)
- ASCII-based hangman drawing
- Replay option after game ends
- Easy to extend (word list or dictionary)
